Big data is an all-encompassing term for any collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to p
rocess them using traditional data processing applications.

The challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and privacy violati
ons. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."[1]

Scientists regularly encounter limitations due to large data sets in many areas, including meteorology, genomics,[2] conn
ectomics, complex physics simulations,[3] and biological and environmental research.[4] The limitations also affect Internet search, finance and business informatics. Data sets grow in size in part because they are increasingly being gathered by ubiquitous information-sensing mobile devices, aerial sensory technologies (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers, and wireless sensor networks.[5][6][7] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[8] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×1018) of data were created;[9]as of 2014, every day 2.3 zettabytes (2.3×1021) of data were created.[10][11] The challenge
for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that straddle the entire organization.[12]
